# Feed-Forward Network in Python
## Implementation of a neural network which can predict handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset only using python's numpy.
Be sure to checkout the two <a href="Neural_network.ipynb">notebooks</a> which contain detailed information about the implementation. <br>
I recommend to open those in google's <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a>.
