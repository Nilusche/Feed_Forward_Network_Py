# Feed-Forward Network in Python
## Implementation of a neural network which can predict handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset only using pyhton's numpy.
This was an optional assignment of the ai-course i took. <br>
Be sure to checkout the two <a href="Neural_network.ipynb">notebooks</a> which contains detailed information about the implementation. <br>
I recommend to open those in google's <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a>.
